# Module-3

I will analyze the financial records of a company and help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process by executing financial analysis on two Python workbooks: PyBank and PyPoll, both of which present real-world scenarios. 

# PyBank

Using the budget_data.csv financial dataset, I will create a Python script that will calculate: 

- The total number of months included in the dataset

- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

# PyPoll

Using a set of poll data called election_data.csv, I will create a Python script that will analyze the votes and calculate each of the following values:

- The total number of votes cast

- A complete list of candidates who received votes

- The percentage of votes each candidate won

- The total number of votes each candidate won

- The winner of the election based on popular vote
